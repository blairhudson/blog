    "\n",
    "1. First you'll need to create a directory structure as follows:\n",

    "    - /blog\n",
    "    -- /posts\n",
    "    -- /output\n",

    "    * `/posts` is where you'll store your Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "    * `/output` will contain the code generated for your blog\n",

    "    `pip install --upgrade \"Nikola[extras]\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change directory to your blog root:\n",

    "4. Start up Nikola, following the prompts to configure your new blog:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `nikola init .`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open `/blog/conf.py` and change the `POSTS` and `PAGES` sections to include the lines as follows. This will allow Nikola to treat `.ipynb` files as blog posts.\n",
